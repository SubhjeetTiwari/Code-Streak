<p id = "para"> Hi, Welcome to the javascript.JavaScript is a programming 
language commonly used in web development. It was originally developed
by Netscape as a meansto add dynamic and interactive elements to websites.
While JavaScript is influenced by Java, the syntax is more similar to C
and is based on ECMAScript, a scripting language developed by Sun Microsystems.

JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, which means the source code is processed
by the client's web browser rather than on the web server. This means JavaScript functions 
can run after a webpage has loaded without communicating with the server. For example,
a JavaScript function may check a web form before it is submitted to make sure all the
required fields have been filled out. The JavaScript code can produce an error message
before any information is actually transmitted to the server. </p>
